# React Concurrent Mode and Suspense Demo.
This project contains example code demonstrating React's upcoming Concurrent Mode and Suspense features.

## Instructions
First, run

    npm install

to install project dependencies.

Start the local development server @ localhost:3000 via

    npm start

## Overview

The examples are:

*   `ex01`

    Demonstrates how a React application becomes unresponsive as the component tree grows, due to the blocking nature of React's render process.

*   `ex02`

    Applies non-blocking rendering - a core Concurrent Mode feature - to `ex02`, allowing the application to stay responsive throughout.

*   `ex03`

    Illustrates the problem of components fetching their data dependencies without any mutual coordination, resulting in a broken user experience with a lot of loading states ("spinners") being displayed. 

*   `ex04`

    Improves `ex03` by implementing data fetching with Suspense, enabling easy orchestration of intentional, user-friendly loading sequences. 

To run each example, see `src/index.js`.

### Comments on example ex04
In contrast to the `useSWR` hook - from the 3rd party [swr](https://swr.now.sh/) library - used in `ex03`, in this example a custom `useFetch` hook, designed to be compatible with the new Suspense mechanism, is used for data fetching (see further comments in `src/ex04/fetch.js`). 

The data fetching pattern implemented in this example differs significantly from `ex03`:

*   In `ex03`, a component such as `User` is rendered first, *before* data fetching commences. 

    The built-in `useEffect` hook is typically used for managing data fetching (the 3rd party `useSWR` hook utilizes `useEffect` in its implementation) and an effect is run _after_ a component's initial render. 

    The React documentation refers to this pattern as [*fetch-on-render*](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-suspense.html#approach-1-fetch-on-render-not-using-suspense). 

*   In `ex04`, data fetching starts *before rendering the component*; in the `App` component, the `selectUser` event handler initiates work in the background via a `startTransition` call that runs the following:
    
    *   A custom `prefetch` method (see `src/ex04/fetch.js`), which immediately kicks off data fetching for the selected user. 
    
    * A low-priority state update of the `showProfile` flag.

    Updating `showProfile` to `true` will start to render the user profile view as part of the background work. When the `User` component is rendered, the data for the selected user may already have arrived and thus React will *transition* from showing the list of users to the user profile view. 

    If the data is not available the component will *suspend*. Again, all of this occurs in the background until the `User` component's data is ready and a transition to the user profile view is made, a period during which the user sees a pending indicator (or the Suspense fallback if the data fetching takes too long, specified by the transition timeout).

    This pattern of fetching data as early as possible is called [*fetch-as-you-render*](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-suspense.html#approach-3-render-as-you-fetch-using-suspense).
